Basic tight-binding calculations of different lattice structures using MATLAB.

Tight-binding theory is used to describe the electronic structure of solids, particularly in crystalline materials. It is based on the assumption that electrons are strongly localized around atomic sites and can "hop" between neighboring atoms. The theory provides a simple yet powerful way to model the behavior of electrons in periodic potentials, such as those found in lattices of metals, semiconductors, and insulators. In
second quantization, tight-binding theory gains a more comprehensive and flexible formulation; instead of dealing with wavefunctions (in the Hilbert space), second quantization uses creation and annihilation operators (in the Fock space) to describe the occupation of quantum states at each site. This formalism allows for an efficient representation of electronic interactions and hopping in lattice structures, providing deeper
insight into the quantum mechanical properties of materials. 

The goal of this project is educational, trying to guide senior undergrad/grad students through step-by-step examples so that the reader may reach a better understanding of tight-binding theory and what it can do. I will upload more examples in the near future, all written in the MATLAB Live Script environment.
